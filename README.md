# Card RPG
This is an rpg system inspired by DitV and Durak. In contrast to most rpg systems, the random variable is playing cards rather than dice. A player is represented in game by their deck.

## Character Creation

First, you are born. Draw six cards from an unweighted deck. These represent who you are as a child, not having decided who you want to be yet. Next, separate the deck that you drew from out by suit, and separate each suit out into 1-5 and 6-10. Now run a series of prequel scenes. In each scene, name a level of conflict; after the scene you'll draw one card from both suits associated with it. If you win the stakes in the conflict, you'll draw from the higher deck; if you lose, from the lower. You can have as many prequel scenes as you want, but after each one you'll have one less card in your hand for the conflict. Record the story of each conflict, along with the cards you got as a result, on your character sheet.

In any prequel encounter, you can work with someone else and both use the resulting story for your characters. If you do this, you each get an extra card as a result, from the suit of your choice (as long as it matches the conflict level). You can only do this once for each other member of your party.


## Conflict

>The local pastor has found out that his coworker isn't *quite* human. He's on his way to deal with that; with a shotgun. You want to stop him.


### Choosing the Stakes

A conflict starts by agreeing on the stakes. Each participant has a reason to resorting to conflict; these should be made clear, and what happens if a participant wins should be agreed upon. It is important to recognize that this step is meta; this is a discussion between the players and the GM about a game mechanic, not a discussion between characters about what they'll agree to do when the conflict ends. The players have to abide by this contract; their characters do not have to be happy about it, and can feel free to attempt to subvert it. In our example conflict, the stakes are; do you stop the pastor from popping his pal? However, even if you do stop him there's nothing that says he can't necessarily try again later, or try poison instead. In this stage the GM also chooses a suit that will be trump for this encounter. This will depend on the setting of the encounter. A chess game would be ♦; a gunfight would be ♠. While this doesn't forbid other cards from being played, the trump suit will be more powerful. Once you have done this, choose who will go first. If it isn't obvious who should start the conflict from setting the scene, the participant with the lowest trump card in their hand should open. Break ties by moving up through trump.

### Actions in Conflict

#### Attacking

On your turn, if you have resolved all open attacks against you, you can attack another player. You do this by placing a card in front of that player. That card must be the same suit as a card that your enemy has taken as a wound in this combat. The exception to this is that if you had no attacks to resolve at the beginning of your turn, you can attack with any suit. When you place that card, you also have to explain what that card represents in the game world. This description should be related in quality to the suit of your card, and an scale to the number on that card.

>You appeal to the pastors better nature, by playing a five of hearts and hoping that will be enough.

#### Defending

On your turn, if you have open attacks against you, you can resolve them by covering them with a greater or equal card of the same suit, or any card in the trump suit (though trump cards need to be covered by matching or higher trump cards). Cards are worth the number written on them, with aces being worth 1 and all face cards worth 10. If you manage to defend against all attacks active against you, push the stacks of cards to enemies of your choice (they need not all go to the same enemy). Treat these as attacks with value equal to the card on the top of the pile. Attacks made this way need not match the suit of the enemies wounds. If no enemy can be attacked, the cards simply leave play.


>The pastor is unconvinced of your sincerity, and tells you that strangers ought to butt out of this towns business; using a seven of hearts.

#### Deflecting

If you have a card in your hand  that matches the number of a card you are being attacked with, you can play it and push both cards to an opponent as two separate attacks. These attacks need not follow the standard rules about suits.

>You remind him that regardless of your standing, his bible is the book that preaches mercy. While he seems distracted by your argument, you snatch the shotgun from his hands. You do this by deflecting his seven of hearts with a seven of spades.

#### Taking a Wound

If you can't or wont defend an open attack against you, you can instead be wounded by it. Place the attack in front of you sideways to represent that it is no longer active. You can only take two wounds in a conflict. If you are forced to take a third wound, you have to concede.

>The pastor can't deal with the seven of spades, and is therefore forced to accept that you now have his shotgun. However, he does have an eight of hearts, and pushes that back to you telling your character that the devil is the one who would twist scripture to his own needs.


#### Conceding

If you feel that this battle isn't winnable, you can at any time concede and withdraw from the fight. You take all open attacks against you as wounds, and give up the stakes. However, you can't be attacked further, which may prevent more wounds.

>You might still win this fight, but you want to keep the pastor on your side, and you think there may be a subtler way to save the coworker. You concede the fight, and hand the pastor back his shotgun.

### Magic

Face cards aren't just valuable combat cards. They represent the impossible, the surreal. When you play a face card, select one of the effects from below.

* Jacks
	* Remove an attack of the same suit as the jack from play
	* Move the top card of an attack to any other attack in play
* Queens
	* Draw a new card from the top of your deck
	* Split the top card of an attack into a new attack against the same player
* Kings
	* Take the top card of an attack into your hand (This card is now yours, permanently)
	* Spread all cards in an attack into different attacks against the same player

These are all immensely powerful effects to have in game, but they come at a cost. Jacks and queens cost one to play, while kings cost two. Keep track of the cost you incur during a conflict. After it has ended, and you've shuffled your hand back into your deck, draw cards from the top of your deck. Each time you draw a card that is not a face card, remove it from your deck; this pays for one unit of cost. Once you have paid down all of the cost, take the cards that you removed and destroy them. You can't get them back; the magic has consumed that part of your character. If at any time you have no cards that are not spell cards or wounds, you are consumed by magic. This essentially means that you are dead, but consult your GM for the details of how it should be handled.

## The GM

The game is run by a GM, who creates the world around you and provides you with conflicts to overcome. However, unlike in more traditional RPG's, the GM is not all powerful. Instead, they describe everything that is happening, and if you disagree with something you can challenge it at any time. At that point a conflict starts, and stakes are negotiated.

### NPC's in Conflict

Any people controlled by the GM who get wrapped up in a conflict will of course need a hand to represent them. Occasionally these people may be fully fleshed out characters with decks of their own that the GM has created, but more often the GM will just save a deck or two for generating all of the NPCs. To generate an NPC, the GM draws 12 cards off of the top of one of these decks, and then goes through the following procedure until they only have six. It is important to follow each step one card at a time, rather than all at once, to make sure you end up with six.

1. Choose a suit that this character will be bad at. Discard all cards of that suit.
2. Choose a suit that this character will be good at. Keep all cards of that suit.
	* If there are more than six cards in that suit, discard the best, then the worst.
	* Repeat that until there are no more than three cards of that suit.
3. Repeat the above until you reach six cards.

### Environments

In addition to people nearby, the GM also runs the environment around the conflict. The environment (usually) has no vested interest in which way a conflict will go. It will hurt or help both sides equally, unless one side can find a way to use it to their advantage. Since environments clearly make no decisions, they are represented by a deck that the GM simply draws off of the top of rather than by a hand.

#### Attack Types

An environment has two different attack types, governed by the color of the cards they use to attack. Red cards attack all participants at once. On your turn, if there is a red environment card on the table, it counts as an attack against you. However, if you deflect it, while you are allowed to act as though it is no longer an attack against you, you don't get to redirect it; it remains in the control of the environment. Similarly, if you cover it, it is simply removed from play. A black card is directed at a single target, like a normal attack. However, the target is not chosen by the GM. Instead, when the environment plays a black card all participants must select a card to reveal from their hand. The player who reveals the lowest card gets attacked.

#### Attributes

An environment is described by a set of attributes. These attributes define how the environment will behave, and what sort of cards it has access to. <!--TODO make attributes-->
